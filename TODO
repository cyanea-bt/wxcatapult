- create a 'dist' target for the Makefile!
- use alternative names for XRC library if it can't be found, or some other way
  to make this more robust
- add documentation, like a manual, if necessary (?)
- define a release procedure and document it in the dummy release files in doc/
- fix bugs?
- add icon that is clearer?
- add a more extensive pluggable setup?
