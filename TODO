- create a 'dist' target for the Makefile!
- use alternative names for XRC library if it can't be found, or some other way
  to make this more robust
- add some files:
  - add documentation, like a manual
  - add information about license and stuff (since it's in the same project as openMSX itself, I think the licenses should also be the same: our project page on sf.net only lists one license... In any case: the same license as openMSX is fine with me and Herman (GPL))
  - add files like README, COPYING, AUTHORS, etc., if we really want that
- define a release procedure and document it
- fix bugs?
- add icon that is clearer?
- add a more extensive pluggable setup?
