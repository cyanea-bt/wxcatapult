Prime Developers:
Herman Oudejans      <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
Manuel Bilderbeek    <manuel@msxnet.org>

The other openMSX developers also contribute to openMSX Catapult every now and
then :)

With many thanks to:
Michael Goettsche    <mail@tuxipuxi.de>
Patrick van Arkel    <vampier@vampier.net>
Albert Beevendorp    <bifi@msxnet.org>

And before altering (or completely rewriting) we
used code from the following contributors: 

Finding a window by process ID:
	Martin-Pierre Frenette  (www.codeproject.com)
Openmsx XML parser:
	Wouter Vermaelen     <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
Linux build system:
	Maarten ter Huurne   <maarten@treewalker.org>

Historical note:

openMSX Catapult was originally developed by Manuel Bilderbeek in Qt 3 (for
Linux), with the help of Michael Goettsche. Soon Herman Oudejans made a Windows
version in Visual Studio with MFC. However, we wanted to make a common program
that is portable to different operating systems, so we started a total rewrite
based on wxWidgets and added it as a subproject to openMSX CVS. This is the
result!
