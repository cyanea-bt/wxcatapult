openMSX Catapult - the GUI for openMSX
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

openMSX Catapult is an optional part (a subproject) of openMSX, the MSX
emulator that aims for perfection. With Catapult you can control openMSX via
a graphical user interface.

Since the program is not very complicated, we expect that it doesn't need a
manual. To understand what all options mean and to get a better feeling of
what openMSX is, we recommend to read the documentation of openMSX.

You can read what has changed in this and the previous releases in the
release notes. You can find the release notes of this release in the file
'release-notes.txt' in the directory 'doc'. Highlights of previous releases
can be found in 'release-history.txt'.

All source code and other works that are part of, or distributed with
Catapult are copyrighted by their respective authors. The file 'AUTHORS'
contains a list of people who made works for Catapult or contributed works to
