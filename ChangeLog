	   from the start.
	* Fixed a bug in returning from fullscreen in Windows.
	* Cataputl should now accept non-dev openmsx versions higher than 
	   0.3.4. This should cause the soon to release 0.4.0 to be accepted as

	  name and type now

	  and README. Also added doc directory with release notes and other
	  stuff, which still need to be filled in! It's mostly copied from
	  openMSX and adjusted for Catapult. But remember: TODO: fill all that
	  stuff in!

2004-04-17 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Fixed: openmsx fatal errors were sometimes repeated over and

	* in case of openmsx crashing, leds are now turned off

	   (thanks to wouter). Removing wxProcess and wxExecute seems 
	   to get rid of the segfault when closing openmsx.
	* fixed wxCatapult.dsp (added winmm library for joystick checking).
	* openmsx 1211 has a new versionstring (openmsx -v). adapted 
	   catapult for it.
	* (un)plugging sounds devices now updates the mixer.

2004-04-11 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>

	* Fixed windows build system. config.h is now created.
	   Unfortunately, I don't know how to set it as a dependency for
	   other files, so if it doesn't work, do a 'rebuild all'
	   - Moved dsp and dsw files to the build directory.
	   - Remove hardpaths (this means that the paths to wx includes and
	     and libs need to be added to: tools->options->directories in vc++).
	     There's no way to automate this, sorry :(
	* Devices can now be plugged in the joystick ports

	   when a disk or tape is changed when openMSX is running.
	* Fixed: Media comboboxes were cleared on launch.

2004-04-06 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* When the configuration dialog is closed with Ok, catapult will
	   now run openmsx -v to make sure all parameter are set properly.
	* If the openmsx executable and/or share directory is changed,
	   catapult tries to restore the previous machine and extensions.
