	* Fixed windows build system. config.h is now created.
	   Unfortunately, I don't know how to set it as a dependency for
	   other files, so if it doesn't work, do a 'rebuild all'
	   - Moved dsp and dsw files to the build directory.
	   - Remove hardpaths (this means that the paths to wx includes and
	     and libs need to be added to: tools->options->directories in vc++).
	     There's no way to automate this, sorry :(

2004-04-06 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
