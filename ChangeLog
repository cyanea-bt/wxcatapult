	* Machine and Extensionlists are now updated and saved.

2005-10-14 Manuel Bilderbeek <manuel@msxnet.org>

2005-03-05 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>

	* Added tool tips for new menus. Fixed some typos.

2005-01-06 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Catapult now works with wxWidgets 2.5.3, however the main screen
	  appears to be too wide.
	* Catapult is now 100% unicode compatible.
	* Added possibility to drop files on diskA,diskB, etc, but that doesn't
	  work in wxmsw because of (yet another) bug in wxWidgets.
	* Added compile targets in vc++ to compile in 2.5.3 with or without
	  unicode. wx2.4 targets are also still available.

2004-12-01 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>

2004-11-14 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* catapult can be compiled in mingw without any alteration of
	  wx-config. The result is still far bigger than using vc++, so it's
	  not perfect yet.

2004-11-11 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Fixed gcc compiler warning (signed/unsigned mismatch) in FOREACH
	  code
	* First step for compiling using mingw:
		- Included <windows.h> where HANDLE is needed
		- Replaced FindWindow() by FindWindowByName() because mingw gets
		  confused about the FindWindow defined in winbase.h (windows.h)
		- Replaced __WINDOWS__ by __WXMSW__ (wx-config has only -D__WXMSW__)
		- Fixed vc++ compiler error in CatapultConfigDlg.

2004-11-10 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>

	* removed some ^M's from AUTHORS file

2004-11-06 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Removed all hard loopends used in combination with static arrays to
	  avoid problem with adding or removing elements in those arrays (e.g.
	  the media types).

2004-11-06 Manuel Bilderbeek <manuel@msxnet.org>
	* Removed all .Cas stuff, and replaced it by two cassetteplayer
	  controls, which still need to be made functional. Thanks to Herman
	  for finding some bugs. See his commit of today :)
	* Internally renamed all Tape(1) stuff to Cassette
	* Some layout tweaks (mainly esthetical) and added tool tip
	* Made Rewind and Force Play buttons functional
	* Disable Cassette stuff when there's no cassette port in the running
	  machine; disable buttons when there's no cassette selected
	  TODO: the controls get disabled briefly (during silent launch) and
	  then get enabled again if the port is found... Fix it if you can! ;)
	* Fixed initial enabled-state of buttons, depending on CassetteComboBox

2004-10-16 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Fixed a problem with inserting a disk while openMSX is running.
	* Fixed a problem with change focus and diskb (value from

	* Paths are now saved as soon as the openMSX config dialog
	   is closed.

2004-10-10 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Fixed printerport plugin mechanism.
	* Instead of using LaunchMode, every openMSX reply
	   is linked to a handler-target. This can be either the
	   interactive handler code or the automatic startup code.
	   Advantage is that commands are no longer ignored, even
	   at startup (Thanks to BifiMsx, Albert Beevendorp, for this
	   solution).

2004-10-08 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>

		    and catapult is started and stopped immidiately,
		    the selected stuff was lost.
	* Machine and extension names can now contain spaces.
	* Added 'touch' in the windows build steps to avoid having to copy
	   the bitmaps over and over again.
	* Cleaned up the output of the windows build process.

	* Windows executable is now created in derived/bin, which is
	   better for package creation.
	* Windows build defaults now to the Release version.
	* Disabled the m_commands assert. When no commands are
	   available, the GetPendingCommand function will return an empty
	   string. Effectively, this means that the reception of a reply without
	   a sent command will simply be ignored.

2004-05-09 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Ported system probe from openMSX to Catapult.

	   to reproduce the assert but just couldn't.

2004-04-27 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Personal share dir is now also used in windows to find machines
	   and extensions
	* Items added to history are now converted to the native (back)slash.
	* file filters with capitals extensions added. .DSK and alike should now be
	   also found in linux.
	* If normal tape (wave) is used and the machine is equiped with a
	   cassetteport it's automaticly plugged.

2004-04-25 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Catapult now initially guesses where openmsx could be and checks
	   for it. If users maintain default values, those values should be good
	   from the start.
	* Fixed a bug in returning from fullscreen in Windows.
	* Cataputl should now accept non-dev openmsx versions higher than
	   0.3.4. This should cause the soon to release 0.4.0 to be accepted as

	* Fixed the layout of the midi/sample panel a bit.

2004-04-20 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>

	* in the mixer, the audio channels have also tooltips with their full
	  name and type now
	* added preliminary documentation files, license file (GPL), AUTHORS
	  and README. Also added doc directory with release notes and other
	  stuff, which still need to be filled in! It's mostly copied from
	  openMSX and adjusted for Catapult. But remember: TODO: fill all that
	  stuff in!

2004-04-17 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Fixed: openmsx fatal errors were sometimes repeated over and
	   over again.
	* Added: Full screen button (disabled in windows for now).
	* Fixed segfault on close catapult while openmsx runs (again).

	* fixed gtk segfault when starting openmsx.
	* in case of openmsx crashing, leds are now turned off
	* Made the linux openmsx launch procedure in linux native code
	   (thanks to wouter). Removing wxProcess and wxExecute seems
	   to get rid of the segfault when closing openmsx.
	* fixed wxCatapult.dsp (added winmm library for joystick checking).
	* openmsx 1211 has a new versionstring (openmsx -v). adapted
	   catapult for it.
	* (un)plugging sounds devices now updates the mixer.

2004-04-11 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* joystickport devices are now prepluggable.

2004-04-08 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Fixed windows build system. config.h is now created.
	   Unfortunately, I don't know how to set it as a dependency for
	   other files, so if it doesn't work, do a 'rebuild all'
	   - Moved dsp and dsw files to the build directory.
	   - Remove hardpaths (this means that the paths to wx includes and
	     and libs need to be added to: tools->options->directories in vc++).
	     There's no way to automate this, sorry :(
	* Devices can now be plugged in the joystick ports
	* Changed default directory behaviour while browsing for openmsx
	   share directory

	* History is updated when a new disk or tape is inserted while
	   openMSX is running.
	* History and used hardware is saved before openMSX is started and
	   when a disk or tape is changed when openMSX is running.
	* Fixed: Media comboboxes were cleared on launch.

2004-04-06 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* When the configuration dialog is closed with Ok, catapult will
	   now run openmsx -v to make sure all parameter are set properly.
	* If the openmsx executable and/or share directory is changed,
	   catapult tries to restore the previous machine and extensions.

	* adapted for openmsx cvs Changelog version 1.1156 (openmsx_info
