Release History
===============

This is an overview of the changes that were incorporated into past releases.

openMSX Catapult 0.6.2-R1 (2007-02-??)
--------------------------------------

This is a release to make openMSX Catapult compatible with openMSX 0.6.2.
No features were added, only some minor bugs were fixed. The plan is to release
a successor for Catapult as soon as possible; unfortunately we didn't make it
in time for openMSX 0.6.2.

openMSX Catapult 0.6.1-R1 (2006-07-30)
--------------------------------------

This is a release to make openMSX Catapult compatible with openMSX 0.6.1.
No features were added, only some minor bugs were fixed. The plan is to work
on a successor of Catapult as soon as possible.

openMSX Catapult 0.6.0-R2 (2006-01-29)
--------------------------------------

This is a bugfix release for Windows users.

One problem was fixed in Catapult itself: no machine was selected at the very
first startup (after scanning the available machines).

A new Windows binary release is built with a differently configured wxWidgets:
the FontMap stuff of wxWidgets gives registry problems for some Windows users,
so we disabled it.

openMSX Catapult 0.6.0-R1 (2006-01-21)
--------------------------------------

User interface:

Added: support for 2 keyjoysticks
Added: dialog to check which openMSX hardware configurations are working.
Added: menu option to display or hide broken hardware configurations.
Added: option to disable config check after setup.
Added: record button for cassette recorder, for new openMSX functionality.
Added: scaler factor selector, for new openMSX functionality.
Fixed: several details.

Compilation:

Added: Support for wxWidgets 2.6.x, which is now preferred as well.

openMSX Catapult 0.5.2-R2 (2005-06-26)
--------------------------------------

This second release of openMSX Catapult 0.5.2 is only a bug fix release.
We found that on platforms that use wxGTK, the extensions didn't work anymore.
This is due to some bug in wxGTK, but we implemented a work around for it in
this release, which should make Catapult usable again. Also, we made some
errors in the new CPU build files, which are corrected in this release.
Note: none of these changes affect Win32 users, so we will not release a new
Win32 binary.
