<h2><a id="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<h3><a id="newver">1.1. New Versions of this Document</a></h3>

<p>
The latest version of the openMSX Catapult manual can be found on the openMSX home page:
</p>
<p>
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sf.net/manual-catapult/">http://openmsx.sf.net/manual-catapult/</a>
</p>
<p>
The latest version of the openMSX manual can also be found there:
</p>
<p>
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sf.net/manual/">http://openmsx.sf.net/manual/</a>
</p>
<p>
You can also use these URLs to get up-to-date versions of the hyperlinks
if you printed out this manual.
</p>

<h3><a id="purpose">1.2. Purpose</a></h3>
<p>
This manual is about Catapult, the (optional) GUI for openMSX.  You can 
find more information about openMSX on the
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sf.net/">openMSX home page</a>. You can 
also download Catapult and the emulator itself from there.
</p>

<p>
openMSX is in alpha state, which means that some things work but not all 
features are implemented yet. Many emulation features are implemented, but in 
terms of user interface it is rather bare bones. However, since the emulation is 
already pretty good, it would be nice if non-insiders would be able to play with 
it, too. To allow people to use openMSX without having to find all options the 
hard way, Catapult was created. Like openMSX, Catapult is still in development 
and doesn't support all features we would like it to, but still it has become a 
great addition to openMSX. This manual assumes that openMSX has already been set up. 
For further details how to setup and use openMSX please refer to the 
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sf.net/manual/">openMSX manuals</a> .
</p>

<p>
Although Catapult was designed to be self explanatory, we still decided to 
create a comprehensive manual to familiarise people with the various pages and 
controls.
</p>

<p>
<em>Disclaimer:</em>
We do not claim this guide is complete or even correct.
What you do with the information in it is entirely at your own risk.
We just hope it helps you enjoy Catapult (and with that openMSX) more.
</p>

<h3><a id="history">1.4. Revision History</a></h3>

<p>
This section gives an overview of the changes that were made to this document.
It doesn't contain every single modification (use the CVS log for that),
only the big picture.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>2004-05-05: Herman Oudejans</dt>
<dd>
Initial version. 
</dd>

</dl>

<h2><a id="starting">2. Starting Catapult</a></h2>

<p>
Linux users can start Catapult by simply typing:
</p>

<div class="commandline">
    catapult
</div>

<p>
Windows users can simply double-click on the catapult icon in the start menu if 
they have chosen to create it during setup. If not, simply find the executable 
and start it anyway you like.
</p>

<p>
When you start Catapult for the first time it will ask where it can find openMSX 
and where the so-called <code>share</code> directory can be found. To make it as easy as possible, Catapult 
first checks the default locations for openMSX to see if the necessary files are 
available. If they are, you only need to press the Ok button. If they are not on 
the default locations, you will need to locate them yourself. Be careful when 
choosing the share directory. openMSX uses two share directories, the system 
share (default: <code>/opt/openMSX/share</code> in Linux and the 
<code>share</code> subdirectory where your openMSX executable resides 
in Windows) and the personal share (default: <code> ~/.openMSX/share</code> 
in Linux and <code>My Documents\openMSX\share</code> in Windows). 
You'll need to fill in the system share directory, because the personal share directory is 
scanned anyway. After you press the Ok button, Catapult's main screen appears.
</p>

<h2><a id="tour">3 A quick tour</a></h2>

<p>
The main screen of Catapult consists of 5 pages to separate different kinds 
of functionality. This creates a much clearer interface than trying to put 
everything on one page. This Section introduces the different pages and how they 
can be used. It also tells about the global section of Catapult.
</p>

<h3><a id="tour_session">3.1. Session Page</a></h3>

<p>
This page lets you select which MSX machine you want to use, what extra 
functionality that machine should have and what kind of media (disks, cassettes 
and cartridges) you insert. This is the most used page of Catapult.
</p>

<h3><a id="tour_misc">3.2. Miscellaneous Control Page</a></h3>

<p>
The Miscellaneous Control Page (also called Misc Control Page). contains the 
controls that can't easily be put in one category. This page contains three types 
of controls:
</p>

<ul>
<li>to set the speed and frame skip of openMSX.</li>
<li>to push special buttons on the MSX within openMSX like power and reset.</li>
<li>to plug devices into the joystick ports of the MSX.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="tour_video">3.3. Video Control Page</a></h3>

<p>
This page contains all controls to select how openMSX should display the MSX 
screen. Some of this controls can cause openMSX to slow down.
</p>

<h3><a id="tour_audio">3.4. Audio Control Page</a></h3>

<p>
When Catapult starts, this page looks completely empty, but once openMSX is 
started, this page contains a mixer of each sound device available in the MSX. 
This page also contains some controls specific to the MSXturboR machines 
concerning MIDI and PCM wave input. These are grayed out when a different 
MSX computer is emulated.
</p>

<h3><a id="tour_status">3.5. Status Page</a></h3>

<p>
This page contains the messages Catapult gets from openMSX. This can be information 
like what cartridge has been found or which machine is used, but it can also 
show warnings or errors that occur. In case of an error, Catapult automatically 
selects this page.
</p>

<h3><a id="tour_global">3.6. Global Section</a></h3>

<p>
The global section can be found in the bottom of the Catapult screen. It 
contains the Start/Stop button to start or stop openMSX. It also contains a 
representation of the LEDs of the MSX. Not all MSX machines have these LEDs, so 
don't be alarmed if some LEDs don't appear to be working. At the bottom of this 
section, you can find the status bar. It displays information about whether or not 
openMSX is running and the number of frames openMSX displays every second (fps).
</p>

<h2><a id="session">4. Using the Session Page</a></h2>

<p>
Below, you can see a screen shot of the Session Page. The left side is used to 
select the hardware of the MSX and the right side specifies which software 
should be inserted into the MSX. All screen shots in this manual were taken in 
Windows XP. In other systems, controls might look a little different but should 
still be easily recognisable.
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="session.png" width="596" height="296" alt="Session Page"></img>
</p>

<h3><a id="hardware">4.1. Selecting hardware</a></h3>

<p>
In the top-left corner, you can select which machine openMSX should emulate. 
Catapult checks both share directories (system and personal) for any machine 
configurations that exist. This means that a directory in <code>share/machines</code> 
should exist and that it should contain the <code>hardwareconfig.xml</code> file. 
Directories not containing that file, will not appear in the list. This doesn't
mean that each machine actually runs. If a machine needs roms and they are not
available, that particular machine just won't run. Catapult won't detect this
lack of roms. You will see the error message showing up in the Status Page.
</p>

<p>
Below that, you can select one or more extensions. Extensions are simply MSX 
cartridges (extensions to the MSX system) that you can plug into the emulated 
MSX. This can be e.g. sound chips, memory mappers or drive 
controllers. You can select as many extensions as you would like in Catapult, 
but openMSX might make a problem. Some problems that can occur are: 
</p>

<ul>
<li> too many extensions need a cartridge slot. There are a limited amount of
such slots available (most machines have only two of them) </li>
<li> two or more selected extensions are basically the same. This can easily
lead to duplicate ID errors.</li> 
<li> one of more extensions were already available in the chosen machine. This
may also lead to duplicate ID errors.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
Note that with Catapult it is not possible to select one extension multiple
times. We don't expect this to be a problem however.
</p>

<h3><a id="software">4.2. Selecting software</a></h3>

<p>
The rest of this page is used for inserting media into your MSX. There are three 
types of media you can use:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>disks:</dt>
<dd>
Most MSX2 or higher machines are equipped with one or more disk drives.
Moreover, openMSX supports a few external drive controllers as extensions. If a
machine doesn't have a disk drive and no such extension was added, Catapult
still lets you use these field. openMSX, however, will in this case ignore the
value filled in. Disks can be changed while openMSX is running (see below).
</dd>
<dt>cartridges:</dt>
<dd>
Any MSX supports cartridges. These are simply put in before the MSX is started. 
openMSX doesn't support replacing cartridges, so while openMSX is running these 
controls will be grayed out (disabled).
</dd>
<dt>cassettes (tapes):</dt>
<dd>
Most MSX1 computers depend on a tape recorder (or data recorder). Most MSX2 or
higher computers support cassette as well. Like using disks, when a machine
doesn't support cassette you can still fill in these fields. openMSX will just
ignore them. As can be seen on the picture above, there are two kinds of tape.
The first is called 'normal tape' in Catapult, which accepts wav-files as input.
These normally require plugging in a cassetteplayer, but Catapult takes care of
that if this type of tape is used. The second is called 'Cas'. this accepts a
.cas-file (a binary representation of the cassette). See the <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.sf.net/manual/user.html#tape">openMSX User's Manual</a> for
more information about using cassettes.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Every media input box is equipped with a history. Just click on the arrow down to 
open the history. With this you can easily select the most recently chosen
files.
</p>

<p>
The button groups on the far right are to insert or remove the various types of 
media. The buttons on the left of these groups present a file selection window, 
in which you can select which media file should be used. The buttons on the 
right are to eject media. No conformation is asked for this.
</p>

<h3><a id="updating">4.3. openMSX and updating media</a></h3>

<p>
Catapult uses two different kinds of updating schemes. When openMSX is not 
running and you change some of the media input boxes, nothing really happens until 
you actually start openMSX. At that moment, the used values are added to the 
history and the history is  saved. Of course, these values are then used in openMSX. 
If openMSX is already running and you change a disk or tape, this will 
be updated according to the following criteria:
</p>

<ul>
<li> when you select a disk or tape using history or the browse facility,
openMSX updates immediately. </li>
<li> when you type in the filename of a disk or tape, openMSX updates as soon as
the cursor leaves the media input box. </li> 
</ul>

<p>
In both cases, the history is updated.
</p>

<h2><a id="control">5. Using the Control Pages</a></h2>

<p>
This section explains what you can do to control many aspects of openMSX. 
Catapult is using the so-called CliComm interface. This interface allows you to 
send messages to openMSX to change a number of settings and parameters. openMSX, 
in its turn, can also send messages to Catapult telling if any setting or 
parameter has been changed and if requested commands have been processed without 
problems.
</p>

<h3><a id="misc">5.1. The Misc Control Page</a></h3>

<p>
Below you see a picture of the Misc Control Page while openMSX is running. If 
openMSX is not running, all controls will be disabled.
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="misc.png" width="590" height="259" alt="Misc Controls Page"></img>
</p>

<p>
The top section of this page consist of a number of controls with which you can
influence the speed and frame skip setting of openMSX. The upper row controls
the speed percentage of openMSX. You can use the slider to select a speed
between 1 and 500%. You can also directly input the speed into the input box.
Finally, the buttons on the right are to set the speed to respectively 100 and
500%. If the selected speed is higher than your PC can manage, openMSX will try
to go as fast as possible. The next row selects how many frames may be maximally
skipped to maintain the chosen speed. The controls here work similar to the
speed controls. Finally, there's the throttle button. This button toggles
between throttle on or off. When throttle is off, openMSX tries to go as fast as
possible, skipping the maximum amount of frames you set with the frame skip
setting. If the throttle is on, openMSX will maintain 50 or 60 fps (depending on
the MSX display frequency).
</p>

<p>
In the centre of this page, you can find the so-called action controls. These 
control the behaviour of the MSX directly. The power control can turn the MSX on 
or off. When Catapult starts openMSX, the power is always on. The Reset button 
resets the MSX. There's not much more that can be said about that. The Pause 
button pauses the emulation completely. Finally, the firmware button lets you 
choose whether or not you want to enable the firmware in the MSX you are
emulating (this is called the frontswitch setting in openMSX).
</p>

<p>
The bottom of this page allows you to put devices into the MSX joystick ports. 
For each port, you can choose between a mouse, keyjoystick and any joysticks 
hooked up to the PC. If you select the same device for both ports, you get a 
warning and a request for confirmation. This allows you to choose which port the 
selected device should be in. These are the only controls that can be modified 
before openMSX is started.
</p>

<h3><a id="video">5.2. The Video Control Page</a></h3>

<p>
Below you see a picture of the Video Control Page while openMSX is running. 
If openMSX is not running, all controls will be disabled.
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="video.png" width="592" height="291" alt="Video Control Page"></img>
</p>

<p>
In the top-left corner, you can select which renderer is used by openMSX.
</p>

<p>
With the top-centre control you can select which scaler should be used. A 
scaler only works if the renderer is set to SDLHi and determines how the picture 
is scaled to 640&times;480. Beware that some scalers can be really slow. The 
algorithms are sometimes quite complex.
</p>

<p>
The top-right control lets you select the accuracy level openMSX uses to draw 
the screen.
</p>

<p>
See for an explanation of renderers, scalers and accuracy the
<a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.sf.net/manual/user.html#renderers">openMSX User's Manual</a>.
</p>

<p>
The deinterlace button toggles the deinterlacing effect on or off. When a real 
MSX is in interlace mode, you can see the screen flashing. When deinterlace is 
off you get that same effect on openMSX. If this toggle is switched on, the 
picture holds perfectly still.
</p>

<p>
The limit sprites button allows you to let openMSX draw as many sprites on a 
horizontal line as necessary. With the sprite limit switched off, some games 
will stop flashing their sprites. This feature is on by default since that's 
closest to a real MSX. Some programs rely on the sprite flicker effect and may
thus look bad if you turn this off.
</p>

<p>
The full screen button switches openMSX to full screen mode. The first time 
you do this, there will be a warning how to get back. You can disable this warning if 
you want to. Windows users can also get back to windowed mode by switching back 
to Catapult (using ALT-TAB) and simply deselecting full screen again.
</p>

<p>
The lower half of this page allows you to modify the openMSX screen. All of 
these settings can be controlled by using the slider, typing the value directly 
into the edit field or using the reset button to refer to the default state. 
These settings are pretty much self-explanatory. Blur and Glow are only 
supported in the SDLGL renderer.
</p>

<h3><a id="audio">5.3. The Audio Control Page</a></h3>

<p>
Below you see a picture of the audio control page while openMSX is running. 
If openMSX is not running, the controls will be disabled and instead of the mixer 
a simple message will be displayed stating: "No audio channel data available".
</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="audio.png" width="590" height="288" alt="Audio Controls Page"></img>
</p>

<p>
The top half of this page is used to adjust the volume and channel mode of the
sound devices present in openMSX. When a slider is all the way up, volume is set
to maximum and if it's all the way down that specific device is muted. The mode 
selector below each slider lets you choose between L(eft), R(ight) and M(ono). 
However, some sound devices only support S(tereo).
</p>

<p>
The bottom part of this page can be used to select where the sound I/O 
devices are redirected to. These controls are only enabled if you're emulating an 
MSXturboR. The top of this section lets you choose what is plugged into the MIDI-IN 
port. You can choose between <code>--empty--</code> and
<code>midi-in-reader</code>. Windows users also have the choice to use one of
the native MIDI devices. The field besides the selector is only used when
<code>midi-in-reader</code> is selected. In this case, this allows you to select
from which file the MIDI input is taken.
</p>

<p>
The second row of controls is to select what is plugged into the MIDI-OUT 
port. Possibilities are <code>--empty--</code> and <code>midi-out-logger</code>. Windows users can, again, 
also select native MIDI devices. The field right of it allows you to select in 
which file the MIDI output is stored in case <code>midi-out-logger</code> is
chosen. In UNIX systems you might want to choose <code>/dev/midi</code> to
route the MIDI data to a MIDI device you have connected to your system.
</p>

<p>
MIDI-IN and MIDI-OUT are only available on the MSXturboR GT.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the last row is to select the PCM wave input. You can choose
<code>--empty--</code>
or <code>wavinput</code>. In case of <code>wavinput</code>, the field besides it selects from which file 
the PCM input is taken.
</p>

<h2><a id="status">6. Status Display</a></h2>

<p>
The status display of Catapult consists of four different elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Status Page</li>
<li>LED Status Display</li>
<li>Emulator Status</li>
<li>Frame rate display</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Status Page displays all messages given by openMSX. This includes 
machine- and rom information, warnings, errors and output from the debug device 
(see the
<a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.sf.net/manual/user.html#debugdevice">openMSX User's Manual</a>
for more information). Informational texts are displayed in black, warnings are displayed
in dark red while errors can be recognised by their bright red colour. This display is cleared 
whenever openMSX is started.
</p>

<p>
The LED Status Display shows the status of the MSX LEDs at any given time. 
Which LEDs are used depends on the type of MSX computer openMSX is emulating. 
The pause LED acts both as MSXturboR pause LED and as an indication that openMSX 
is paused.
</p>

<p>
On the left side of the status bar you can see whether or not the emulator is 
running. This can be convenient if you have multiple Catapults running.
</p>

<p>
Finally, on the right side of the status bar, you'll find the frame rate 
display, which shows you how many frames openMSX is displaying per
second. When the emulator runs at 100% speed, this should be 50 or 60 fps 
(depending on the current display frequency of the MSX). When you increase the speed of 
openMSX, the fps count should also be increased. Bear in mind that when using 
SDLGL (openGL), your video driver may force the fps to your monitor refresh rate 
to avoid disturbance while drawing. Also, if this display shows a frame rate
below 50 fps, your computer is actually a bit to slow to generate all frames in
time with the current settings and thus frames are being skipped.
