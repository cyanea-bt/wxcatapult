<h2><a id="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<h3><a id="newver">1.1. New Versions of this Document</a></h3>
<p>
The latest version of the openMSX Catapult manual can be found on the openMSX home page:
</p>
<p>
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sf.net/manual-catapult/">http://openmsx.sf.net/manual-catapult/</a>
</p>
<p>
The latest version of the openMSX manual can also be found there:

</p>
<p>
You can also use these URLs to get up-to-date versions of the hyperlinks if you
printed out this manual.
</p>

<h3><a id="purpose">1.2. Purpose</a></h3>
<p>
This guide is about Catapult, the (optional) GUI for openMSX. You can find more
information about openMSX on the <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.sf.net/">openMSX home page</a>.
You can also download the emulator itself from there.
</p>

<p>
openMSX is in alpha state, which means that some things work but not all
features are implemented yet.
Many emulation features are implemented, but in terms of user interface it is
rather bare bones.
That's why we decided to create a GUI for it, so most users can use it a little
bit more comfortably.
For people who want to (or have to) compile Catapult themselves, we have written
this guide.
It explains how you can get it running on your system, i.e. how to get the
sources and compile them.
</p>

<p>
This guide describes how you can get the Catapult sources and compile them on a
Linux or Windows machine. Most users will probably never compile it on a Windows
system (Windows users generally like binaries), but for those who do want to
compile, this manual gives a few pointers in the right direction. Linux users
don't have a choice most of the time. Every distribution is different and
binaries are hardly exchangeable. Compilation on *BSD works more or less the
same as on Linux and differences are noted in the appropriate sections. Other
systems that are supported by wxWidgets (formerly known as wxWindows) should
work, but for those cases it might take some extra attention to get it compiled.
If you are compiling on such a platform, please share your experiences (see
below for <a class="internal" href="#contact">contact info</a>), so we can make
Catapult more portable.
</p>

<p>
<em>Disclaimer:</em>
We do not claim this guide is complete or even correct.
What you do with the information in it is entirely at your own risk.
We just hope it helps you enjoy Catapult (and with that openMSX) more.
</p>

<h3><a id="history">1.4. Revision History</a></h3>

<p>
This section gives an overview of the changes that were made to this document.
It doesn't contain every single modification (use the CVS log for that),
only the big picture.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>2004-04-25 Herman Oudejans</dt>
<dd>Initial version based on the openMSX manuals by Manuel Bilderbeek, Jorrith 
Schaap and Maarten ter Huurne.</dd>

</dl>

<h2><a id="getsource">2. Getting the Source Code</a></h2>

<p>
Catapult is a sub-project of openMSX, developed using the tools <a
class="external" href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</a> freely
offers to open source projects. The code is stored in CVS, an open source
version management system. Once in a while a Catapult release is made. At this
point in time, we do not know yet how we will organise the release of Catapult:
either together with openMSX or seperate releases in some form.
</p>

<p>
There are several options for getting the source code:
</p>

<dl>

<dt><a class="internal" href="#getrelease">Released Version</a></dt>
<dd>
These are tested versions, which should give you little problem compiling and
running.
However, as Catapult development is often quite fast, they may not have all the
latest features.
Also there could be bugs that have been fixed since the last release.
</dd>

<dt><a class="internal" href="#getcvs">CVS Checkout</a></dt>
<dd>
Through anonymous CVS you can get the same development version the Catapult
developers are using. This is the bleeding edge: the latest stuff, which may be
great or may be horribly broken. Usually Catapult CVS compiles and runs fine,
but we're only human, so once in a while it breaks. Also there may be changes
that are not documented yet.
</dd>

<dt><a class="internal" href="#getsnapshot">CVS Snapshot</a></dt>
<dd>
A snapshot is created from a recent CVS checkout, in a <code>tar.gz</code>
archive. A snapshot is therefore quite similar to a CVS checkout, but it
doesn't require you to install and use CVS.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
Releases are intended for general users, CVS and CVS snapshots are intended for
(would be) developers, heavy testers and people who want to follow new
developments closely. It might be a good idea to play with a release first. If
you like what you see and want to get in deeper, you can switch to CVS later.
If you update often, it is best to use a CVS checkout rather than a CVS
snapshot, because with a checkout you can do efficient incremental updates,
saving network bandwidth and compile time.
</p>

<p>
If you downloaded a version that is either a lot older or a lot newer than this
guide, it is a good idea to read the guide included in your downloaded version
instead of the version you're reading right now.
You can find the Compilation Guide in the directory
<code>Catapult/doc/manual</code>.
</p>

<h3><a id="getrelease">2.1. Released Version</a></h3>

<p>
You can download a released version of Catapult from <a class="external"
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=38274"
>the download page at SourceForge</a>.
The latest version is probably the best one.
</p>

<p>
After downloading, type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">tar xzvf Catapult-VERSION.tar.gz</div>
<p>
in which <code>VERSION</code> is the Catapult version you downloaded, or use the
file name you saved the tar.gz file with.
The directory that is created by uncompressing the <code>tar.gz</code> file is
called the <em>top of the source tree</em>.
</p>

<p>
Note: Windows doesn't natively support tar or gzip, but there are enough
utilities available to decompress these sources anyway. Examples of such
utilities are PowerArchiver 6.1 (free), Wiz (free), 7-zip (free) or WinZip
(commercial).
</p>

<h3><a id="getcvs">2.2. CVS Checkout</a></h3>

<p>
Getting a CVS checkout means you use CVS to retrieve the latest version of the
source code of Catapult.
This means you will need to install a CVS client.
This package is usually simply named <code>cvs</code>.
There are graphical front-ends for CVS, but this guide will tell you how to use
CVS from the command line.
More information about CVS can be found on the <a class="external"
href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS Home</a> site. On this site you can also find
a CVS command line tool for Windows.
</p>

<p>
With the following line you can login to the openMSX CVS server:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/openmsx login
</div>
<p>
In this line you specified where you want to retrieve the files from (host name
of the CVS server), as who you want to retrieve the stuff (since you're not a
developer, <code>anonymous</code> will do), and what project you want to
retrieve (openmsx in this case, since Catapult is a sub-project of openMSX).
</p>

<p>
You will be prompted for a password.
The password for user <code>anonymous</code> is empty, so just press enter.
</p>

<p>
Example output:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
jorrith@jardel openmsx $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/openmsx login
</div>
<div class="commandline">
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:2401/cvsroot/openmsx
</div>
<div class="commandline">
CVS password:
</div>
<div class="commandline">
jorrith@jardel openmsx $
</div>

<p>
Now you can retrieve the latest sources with the following command:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/openmsx checkout 
Catapult
</div>
<p>
This will create a directory called <code>Catapult</code> for you in the current
directory.
This directory created by CVS is the called <em>top of the source tree</em>.
In addition to the Catapult code, you will see CVS administration directories
which are all called <code>CVS</code>.
Do not mess with these, otherwise CVS will get confused.
</p>
<p>
If you want to update your source tree later, go to the top of the source tree
and type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
cvs update -d
</div>
<p>
The <code>-d</code> option tells CVS to check out new directories that were
created since your last checkout/update.
</p>

<h3><a id="getsnapshot">2.3. CVS Snapshot</a></h3>

<p>
First, download the
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/Catapult-CVS-snapshot.tar.gz">most recent CVS snapshot</a>.
</p>

<p>
After downloading, type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">tar xzvf Catapult-CVS-snapshot.tar.gz</div>
<p>
The directory that is created by uncompressing the <code>tar.gz</code> file
is called the <em>top of the source tree</em>.
</p>

<h2><a id="compile">3. Compilation</a></h2>

<p>
Before you can start compiling Catapult, you have to make sure your system has
all the necessary build tools installed, as well as the libraries Catapults
depends upon. The former you have probably already done if you have compiled
openMSX itself before Catapult.
The following sections list the packages you need.
</p>

<h3><a id="tools">3.1. Build Tools</a></h3>

<p>
For compilation in Linux, you need Make and a C++ compiler.
If you have compiled packages from source before (like openMSX), you probably
have these installed already.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>make</dt>
<dd>GNU implementation of the Make tool.
Make interprets rules that define how a project should be built.</dd>

<dt>g++</dt>
<dd>The GNU C++ compiler.
Version 3.2 or 3.3 is recommended;
2.95 is not supported for openMSX, so we also don't support it for
Catapult.</dd>

</dl>

<p>
For compilation in Windows you will need Microsoft Visual Studio. Catapult 
was written with version 6.0. If it also compiles on higher versions is unknown 
at this point. You also need to download <code>sed.exe</code> from
<a class="external" href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Home</a>.
</p>


<h3><a id="libs">3.2. Libraries</a></h3>

<p>
Catapult depends on a few libraries.
Using Linux you must have the runtime packages of these libraries installed to
be able to run Catapult.
The runtime package for the "Foo" library is typically called
<code>libfoo</code>.
Also, for compiling Catapult you need the development packages of these
libraries installed as well.
Development packages are typically named <code>libfoo-dev</code> or
<code>libfoo-devel</code>. Windows users need to have the proper dll's installed
(<code>foo.dll</code>) to be able to run Catapult.
Compiling in Windows means that you also need the lib-files
(<code>foo.lib</code>).
</p>

<p>
If there are no binary versions of the required libraries available for your system or you 
rather compile them yourself, please see the next section for a few hints about compiling 
them from their sources.
</p>

<p>
First of all, you need some wxWidgets packages or libraries. Not every
distribution has these available yet. If they are not available for you, please
refer the next section. Note that for Windows there are even no binary releases
available.
On a Debian testing system, the packages are called:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>libwxgtk-2.4</dt>
<dd>wxWindows Cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit (GTK+ runtime). This is the main runtime wxWidgets library</dd>

<dt>libwxgtk-2.4-dev</dt>
<dd>This package contains the necessary headers to compile.</dd>

<dt>libwxgtk-2.4-contrib</dt>
<dd>Needed to be able to use the resources of Catapult.</dd>

<dt>libwxgtk-2.4-contrib-dev</dt>
<dd>And the accompanied headers</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Furthermore, you need the XML library that is also used in openMSX itself. In Debian they are called:</p>

<dl>
<dt>libxml2 and libxml2-dev</dt>
<dd>XML C library, originally developed for GNOME.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a id="complibs">3.3. Compilation of the libraries</a></h3>

<p>
For some distributions it's necessary to manually compile the libraries. This 
section gives a few pointers to get it to work. It's not intended to be a 
substitute for the documentation supplied with the libraries. The wxWidgets 
sources can be found at <a class="external" href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">
wxWidgets Home</a> and the libxml2 sources are available at
<a class="external" href="http://www.xmlsoft.org">Libxml2 Home</a>.
</p>

<p>
In Linux, the compilation of wxWidgets is quite straightforward. Just follow the
docs provided with the library and the wxgtk library should be created. 
Don't forget to change to the directory <em>top of the source
tree</em><code>/wxGTK-2.4.2/contrib</code> and build those libraries too. You'll
need the XRC library for Catapult. 
Compilation of libxml2 is also easy. The libxml2 documentation should give more
than enough information to build it.
</p>

<p>
wxWidgets uses a configuration file to be able to select which features should
be compiled into the library. If these settings are wrong it won't be possible
to use the Catapult resources, which are essential for running Catapult. 
This configuration file is called <code>setup.h</code> and can be found in
<em>top of the source tree</em><code>/wxWindows-2.4.2/include/wx/msw</code>, for
Windows.  Make sure you adjust the following settings:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>#define wxUSE_PROPSHEET 1</code></li>
<li><code>#define wxUSE_PROLOGIO 1</code></li>
<li><code>#define wxUSE_WX_RESOURCES 1</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
Without these adjustments the XRC library won't compile. Also, because of the
<code>PROLOGIO</code> setting, you won't be able to build a unicode library.
After changing these settings, compilation should be easy (using the
<code>wxWindows.dsw</code> file in Visual C++). After compilation you should
make these libraries available to Visual C++.
</p>

<p>
After compiling the wxWidgets library it's time for the XRC extension.
Its sources can be found in <em>top of the source tree</em>
<code>/wxWindows-2.4.2/contrib/src/xrc</code>.
In Visual C++, open the workspace file (<code>XrcVC.dsw</code>) and go to
Project Settings-&gt;Library.
Make sure the dll-linked version and the statically linked version don't point
to the same file. Catapult uses the statically linked version and expects it to
be called:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>wxxrcs.lib</code> (Release version)</li>
<li><code>wxxrcds.lib</code> (Debug version)</li>
</ul>

<p>
After the link targets are changed you can compile the library and make it
available for Visual C++.
</p>

<p>Building the libxml2 library should be easy enough with the docs available.
</p>

<h3><a id="compilenow">3.4. Compilation Itself</a></h3>

<p>
We have made compilation of Catapult itself as easy as possible. In most cases
Linux users only have to open a shell, go to the top of the source tree and
type:
</p>

<div class="commandline">
make
</div>

<p>
With some distributions you might need to change the name of the XRC library in 
the Makefile. TODO: this will hopefully be fixed by Maarten!
</p>

<p>
In Windows, just open <code>wxCatapult.dsw</code> (it's in the 
build-directory) and compile it.
</p>

<p>
Depending on how fast your system is,
this may take several seconds to several minutes.
</p>

<p>
If you get errors during compilation, verify that you installed <a
class="internal" href="#libs">all required libraries</a>, both the run time and
development packages.
If that doesn't help, or we forgot to list a library Catapult depends on, <a
class="internal" href="#contact">contact the openMSX developers</a>.
Make sure you provide us with the error message(s) you got.
</p>

<h2><a id="install">4. Installation</a></h2>

<p>
To install Catapult in Linux, run the following command:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
make install
</div>
<p>
This installs Catapult, by default in <code>/opt/openMSX-Catapult</code>.
You can change this location by modifying the <code>config.mk</code> file.
Note that only root has rights to write to system-wide directories such as
<code>/opt</code>, so you may have to do <code>su</code> before <code>make
install</code>.
</p>

<p>
Windows doesn't really provide us with an installation system, so it's up to you
to make sure the files are in the right directory. Please follow these pointers 
to make sure it should work:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Catapult.exe</code> and <code>libxml2.dll</code> should be in the same directory
or <code>libxml2.dll</code> should be somewhere in your path</li>
<li>The resources (XRC) should be in the directory (relative from 
<code>Catapult.exe</code>) <code>..\resources\dialogs</code></li>
<li>The bitmaps (bmp) should be in the directory (also relative 
from <code>Catapult.exe</code>) <code>..\resources\bitmaps</code></li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="next">5. Next Steps</a></h2>

<p>
If all went well, you should have Catapult installed now.
You can test it by executing Catapult:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
catapult
</div>
<p>or double click the icon in Windows, e.g.</p>

<p>
Using Catapult should be intuitive, but if it's not, please read the <a
class="external" href="user.html">Catapult User Manual</a>. This should give a
complete description on how to use Catapult.
</p>

<p>
If you got stuck somewhere in the compilation and installation process, please
contact us. The next chapter will tell you how.
</p>

<h2><a id="contact">6. Contact Info</a></h2>
