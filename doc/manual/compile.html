<h2><a id="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<h3><a id="newver">1.1. New Versions of this Document</a></h3>
<p>
The latest version of the openMSX Catapult manual can be found on the openMSX home page:
</p>
<p>
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/catapult-manual/">http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/catapult-manual/</a>
</p>
<p>
The latest version of the openMSX manual can also be found there:
</p>
<p>
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/manual/">http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/manual/</a>
</p>
<p>
You can also use these URLs to get up-to-date versions of the hyper links if you
printed out this manual.
</p>

<h3><a id="purpose">1.2. Purpose</a></h3>
<p>
This guide is about Catapult, the (optional) GUI for openMSX. You can find more
information about openMSX on the <a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/">openMSX home page</a>.
You can also download the emulator itself from there.
</p>

<p>
openMSX is in alpha state, which means that some things work but not all
features are implemented yet.
Many emulation features are implemented, but in terms of user interface it is
rather bare bones.
That's why we decided to create a GUI for it, so most users can use it a little
bit more comfortably.
For people who want to (or have to) compile Catapult themselves, we have written
this guide.
It explains how you can get it running on your system, i.e. how to get the
sources and compile them.
Note that some software distributions may have packaged openMSX Catapult and will enable you to install it directly using package management tools. We refer to the documentation of the tools of the distribution you are using to install openMSX Catapult. If you use such a package, you can skip the largest part of this manual and start reading at chapter <a class="internal" href="#next">5. Next Steps</a>.
</p>

<p>
This guide describes how you can get the openMSX sources and compile them.
The level of support for compilation depends on the operating system:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Linux</dt>
<dd>
Most openMSX developers run some form of Linux, so this is the platform on which compilation is supported best. Compilation instructions for Linux are mostly also valid for other UNIX-like operating systems.
</dd>
<dt>Windows</dt>
<dd>
Most Windows users will just download the binary release. But if you want to follow the latest developments or like to play with the code a bit, it is possible to compile Catapult on Windows yourself. The former main Catapult developer used mainly Windows, so compilation is very well supported on this platform as well. This manual gives a few pointers in the right direction for that.
</dd>
<dt>FreeBSD</dt>
<dd>
Catapult was compiled successfully on FreeBSD 4 and 5. FreeBSD is not a platform we support officially, but whenever a user finds compilation problems on FreeBSD, we fix them, so usually FreeBSD compilation should work.
</dd>
<dt>Mac OS X</dt>
<dd>
Unfortunately, we have not been able to get Catapult working on Mac OS X. There is a port of wxWidgets (the base of Catapult), but version 2.4 doesn't support toggle buttons yet and we did not get the menu working (amongst other things) with version 2.6.
</dd>
<dt>other operating systems</dt>
<dd>
Catapult theoretically can compile on every system where you have g++ (the C++ compiler of GCC) and the required libraries are available. However, in practice every system is slightly different and a new operation system will not work out-of-the-box. Still, it shouldn't take much effort to make Catapult build on a new OS.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
If you need help compiling Catapult, please
<a class="internal" href="#contact">contact us</a>.
If you needed any modifications to make Catapult compile,
please send those modifications to us,
so we can make Catapult ever more portable.
</p>

<p>
<em>Disclaimer:</em>
We do not claim this guide is complete or even correct.
What you do with the information in it is entirely at your own risk.
We just hope it helps you enjoy Catapult (and with that openMSX) more.

<h2><a id="getsource">2. Getting the Source Code</a></h2>

<p>
Catapult is a sub-project of openMSX, developed using the tools <a
class="external" href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</a> freely
offers to open source projects. The code is stored in CVS, an open source
version management system.
Catapult is released at every openMSX release.
It can be released in between openMSX releases as well, if there is a lot
of development that we want to share with the users without waiting for the
next openMSX release.
</p>

<p>
There are several options for getting the source code:
</p>

<dl>

<dt><a class="internal" href="#getrelease">Released Version</a></dt>
<dd>
These are tested versions, which should give you little problem compiling and
running.
However, as Catapult development is often quite fast, they may not have all the
latest features.
Also there could be bugs that have been fixed since the last release.
</dd>

<dt><a class="internal" href="#getcvs">CVS Checkout</a></dt>
<dd>
Through anonymous CVS you can get the same development version the Catapult
developers are using. This is the bleeding edge: the latest stuff, which may be
great or may be horribly broken. Usually Catapult CVS compiles and runs fine,
but we're only human, so once in a while it breaks. Also there may be changes
that are not documented yet.
</dd>

<dt><a class="internal" href="#getsnapshot">CVS Snapshot</a></dt>
<dd>
A snapshot is created from a recent CVS checkout, in a <code>tar.gz</code>
archive. A snapshot is therefore quite similar to a CVS checkout, but it
doesn't require you to install and use CVS.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
Releases are intended for general users, CVS and CVS snapshots are intended for
(would be) developers, heavy testers and people who want to follow new
developments closely. It might be a good idea to play with a release first. If
you like what you see and want to get in deeper, you can switch to CVS later.
If you update often, it is best to use a CVS checkout rather than a CVS
snapshot, because with a checkout you can do efficient incremental updates,
saving network bandwidth and compile time.
</p>

<p>
If you downloaded a version that is either a lot older or a lot newer than this
guide, it is a good idea to read the guide included in your downloaded version
instead of the version you're reading right now.
You can find the Compilation Guide in the directory
<code>Catapult/doc/manual</code>.
</p>

<h3><a id="getrelease">2.1. Released Version</a></h3>

<p>
You can download a released version of Catapult from <a class="external"
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=38274"
>the download page at SourceForge</a>.
The latest version is probably the best one. At least try to get one matching the version of openMSX you are using.
</p>

<p>
After downloading, type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">tar xzvf Catapult-VERSION.tar.gz</div>
<p>
in which <code>VERSION</code> is the Catapult version you downloaded, or use the
file name you saved the tar.gz file with.
The directory that is created by uncompressing the <code>tar.gz</code> file is
called the <em>top of the source tree</em>.
</p>

<p>
Note: Windows doesn't natively support tar or gzip, but there are enough
utilities available to decompress these sources anyway. Examples of such
utilities are PowerArchiver 6.1 (free), Wiz (free), 7-zip (free) or WinZip
(commercial).
</p>

<h3><a id="getcvs">2.2. CVS Checkout</a></h3>

<p>
Getting a CVS checkout means you use CVS to retrieve the latest version of the
source code of Catapult.
This means you will need to install a CVS client.
This package is usually simply named <code>cvs</code>.
There are graphical front-ends for CVS, but this guide will tell you how to use
CVS from the command line.
More information about CVS can be found on the <a class="external"
href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS Home</a> site. For Windows, we recommend to use <a class="external" href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/">TortoiseCVS</a>.</p>

<p>
With the following line you can login to the openMSX CVS server:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@openmsx.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/openmsx login
</div>
<p>
In this line you specified where you want to retrieve the files from (host name
of the CVS server), as who you want to retrieve the stuff (since you're not a
developer, <code>anonymous</code> will do), and what project you want to
retrieve (openmsx in this case, since Catapult is a sub-project of openMSX). If you use TortoiseCVS, make sure CVSROOT is set to the large string behind the "-d".
</p>

<p>
You will be prompted for a password.
The password for user <code>anonymous</code> is empty, so just press enter.
</p>

<p>
Example output:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
jorrith@jardel openmsx $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@openmsx.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/openmsx login
</div>
<div class="commandline">
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@openmsx.cvs.sourceforge.net:2401/cvsroot/openmsx
</div>
<div class="commandline">
CVS password:
</div>
<div class="commandline">
jorrith@jardel openmsx $
</div>

<p>
Now you can retrieve the latest sources with the following command:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@openmsx.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/openmsx checkout Catapult
</div>
<p>
For TortoiseCVS make sure to checkout the Catapult module.
This will create a directory called <code>Catapult</code> for you in the current
directory.
This directory created by CVS is the called <em>top of the source tree</em>.
In addition to the Catapult code, you will see CVS administration directories
which are all called <code>CVS</code>.
Do not mess with these, otherwise CVS will get confused.
</p>
<p>
If you want to update your source tree later, go to the top of the source tree
and type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
cvs update -d
</div>
<p>
The <code>-d</code> option tells CVS to check out new directories that were
created since your last checkout/update.
</p>

<h3><a id="getsnapshot">2.3. CVS Snapshot</a></h3>

<p>
Snapshots for this version of Catapult are not available anymore, because we are working on a total rewrite of Catapult. It doesn't seem useful to provide snapshots for sources that do not change anymore. You can download an SVN snapshot of the Catapult rewrite from <a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sf.net/">the openMSX web site</a>.
</p>
<!--
<p>
After downloading, type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">tar xzvf Catapult-CVS-snapshot.tar.gz</div>
<p>
The directory that is created by uncompressing the <code>tar.gz</code> file
is called the <em>top of the source tree</em>.
</p>
-->
<h2><a id="compile">3. Compilation</a></h2>

<p>
Before you can start compiling Catapult, you have to make sure your system has
all the necessary build tools installed, as well as the libraries Catapult
depends upon. The former you have probably already done if you have compiled
openMSX itself before Catapult.
The following sections list the packages you need.
</p>

<h3><a id="tools">3.1. Build Tools</a></h3>

<p>
For compilation in Linux, you need Make and a C++ compiler.
If you have compiled packages from source before (like openMSX), you probably
have these installed already.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>make</dt>
<dd>GNU implementation of the Make tool.
Make interprets rules that define how a project should be built.</dd>

<dt>g++</dt>
<dd>The GNU C++ compiler.
Version 3.2 or later is necessary;
2.95 is not supported for openMSX, so we also don't support it for
Catapult. To be on the safe side: we recommend 3.4 or later.</dd>

</dl>

<p>
For compilation in Windows you will need one of the following:
</p>
<dl>

<dt>Microsoft Visual C++</dt>
<dd>Catapult was written with version 6.0. Whether it also compiles on higher
versions is unknown at this point. You also need to download <code>sed.exe</code> from
<a class="external" href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Home</a> and <code>touch.exe</code>
from <a class="external" href="http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/">UnxUtils</a>. Although this may still work, we haven't tested this in ages, so in case of problems, please revert to the MinGW method described below.</dd>

<dt>The combination of Minimal System (msys) and Minimalist GNU for Windows (MinGW)</dt>
<dd>This is the same combination that is needed to compile openMSX on Windows.
Although compilation works, the generated executable will be larger than the
binary released version (which is compiled with Visual C++) and will also need the MinGW runtime DLL.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a id="libs">3.2. Libraries</a></h3>

<p>
Catapult depends on a few libraries.
Using Linux you must have the runtime packages of these libraries installed to
be able to run Catapult.
The runtime package for the "Foo" library is typically called
<code>libfoo</code>.
Also, for compiling Catapult you need the development packages of these
libraries installed as well.
Development packages are typically named <code>libfoo-dev</code> or
<code>libfoo-devel</code>. Windows users need to have the proper DLL's installed
(<code>foo.dll</code>) to be able to run Catapult.
Compiling in Windows means that you also need the lib-files
(<code>foo.lib</code>).
</p>

<p>
If there are no binary versions of the required libraries available for
your system or you rather compile them yourself, please see the next section
for a few hints about compiling them from their sources.
</p>

<p>
First of all, you need some wxWidgets (formerly known as wxWindows) packages
 or libraries.
On a Debian testing system, the packages are called:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>libwxgtk2.6-0</dt>
<dd>wxWindows Cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit (GTK+ runtime). This is the
main runtime wxWidgets library</dd>

<dt>libwxgtk2.6-dev</dt>
<dd>This package contains the necessary headers to compile.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Although other versions are available, we recommend to use wxWidgets 2.6, although for Windows we have seen that wxWidgets 2.8.8 (e.g.) also works fine, so we assume you're using that version (it's 2.6 compatible).
</p>

<p>
For Windows there are no binary releases available.
Please read the next section for instructions for compiling wxWidgets from source.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, you need the XML library that is also used in openMSX itself.
In Debian its packages are called:</p>

<dl>
<dt>libxml2 and libxml2-dev</dt>
<dd>XML C library, originally developed for GNOME.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a id="complibs">3.3. Compilation of the Libraries</a></h3>

<p>
For some distributions it's necessary to manually compile the libraries. This
section gives a few pointers to get it to work. It's not intended to be a
substitute for the documentation supplied with the libraries. The wxWidgets
sources can be found at <a class="external" href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">
wxWidgets Home</a> and the libxml2 sources are available at
<a class="external" href="http://www.xmlsoft.org">Libxml2 Home</a>.
</p>

<p>Building the libxml2 library should be easy enough with the docs available. You can also use the libraries that are built in openMSX using the staticbindist method.
</p>

<p>Compilation of wxWidgets couldn't be more straightforward. The docs provided
are easy to follow and it takes only a few steps. There is no need to give
any pointers here about this library as its documentation says exaclty how to compile it. We do give the proper <code>configure</code> command line here (although some options might be already default):
</p>

<div class="commandline">
./configure  --disable-shared --disable-unicode --enable-xrc --enable-controls --with-msw
</div>

<h3><a id="compilenow">3.4. Compilation Itself</a></h3>

<p>
We have made compilation of Catapult itself as easy as possible. In most cases
Linux or msys users only have to open a shell, go to the top of the source tree and
type:
</p>

<div class="commandline">
make
</div>

<p>
You can build different flavours by setting the <code>CATAPULT_FLAVOUR</code> environment variable.
The following values are supported:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>debug</dt>
<dd>No optimisation and full debug symbols</dd>
<dt>devel</dt>
<dd>Some optimisation but still full debug symbols available (this is the recommended flavour for testing)</dd>
<dt>i686</dt>
<dd>Fully optimised and no debug symbols (this is the default flavour)</dd>
<dt>opt</dt>
<dd>Basically the same as i686, but also for non Intel targets</dd>
<dt>ppc</dt>
<dd>Specifically for Power PC processors</dd>
<dt>win32</dt>
<dd>Optimised for PIII but runnable with Pentium MMX and higher</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In Visual Studio, just open <code>build\wxCatapult.dsw</code>, choose a target
and build it.
</p>

<p>
Depending on how fast your system is,
this may take several seconds to several minutes.
</p>

<p>
If you get errors during compilation, verify that you installed <a
class="internal" href="#libs">all required libraries</a>, both the run time and
development packages.
If that doesn't help, or we forgot to list a library Catapult depends on, <a
class="internal" href="#contact">contact the openMSX developers</a>.
Make sure you provide us with the error message(s) you got.
</p>

<h2><a id="install">4. Installation</a></h2>

<p>
To install Catapult in Linux, run the following command:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
make install
</div>
<p>
This installs Catapult, by default in <code>/opt/openMSX-Catapult</code>.
You can change this location by modifying the <code>config.mk</code> file.
Note that only root has rights to write to system-wide directories such as
<code>/opt</code>, so you may have to do <code>su</code> before <code>make
install</code>.
</p>

<p>
Windows doesn't really provide us with an installation system, so it's up to you
to make sure the files are in the right directory. Please follow these pointers
to make sure it should work:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Catapult.exe</code> and <code>libxml2.dll</code> (or <code>libxml2-2.dll</code>) should be in the same directory
or <code>libxml2.dll</code> should be somewhere in your path</li>
<li>The same goes for <code>mingwm10.dll</code>, when compiling with MinGW</li>
<li>The resources (XRC) should be in the directory (relative from
<code>Catapult.exe</code>) <code>..\resources\dialogs</code></li>
<li>The bitmaps (png) should be in the directory (also relative
from <code>Catapult.exe</code>) <code>..\resources\bitmaps</code></li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="next">5. Next Steps</a></h2>

<p>
If all went well, you should have Catapult installed now.
You can test it by starting Catapult from the command line:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
catapult
</div>
<p>or by double clicking the icon in Windows.</p>

<p>
Using Catapult should be intuitive, but if it's not, please read the <a
class="external" href="user.html">Catapult User's Manual</a>. This should give a
complete description on how to use Catapult.
</p>

<p>
If you got stuck somewhere in the compilation and installation process, please
contact us. The next chapter will tell you how.
</p>

<h2><a id="contact">6. Contact Info</a></h2>
