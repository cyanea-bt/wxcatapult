=====================================================

Catapult release to match openMSX 0.9.1. No changes in Catapult.

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- the select extension listbox doesn't work properly when using wxWidgets 2.6.x
  (and later) Use the spacebar to deselect extensions!
- not feature complete, especially for newer features you will have to revert to
  the openMSX console (press F10) or the OSD menu (MENU key)
