Release Notes for openMSX Catapult 0.6.0-R2 (2006-01-29)
========================================================

This is a bugfix release for Windows users.

One problem was fixed in Catapult itself: no machine was selected at the very
first startup (after scanning the available machines).

A new Windows binary release is built with a differently configured wxWidgets:
the FontMap stuff of wxWidgets gives registry problems for some Windows users,
so we disabled it.
