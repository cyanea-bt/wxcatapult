Release Notes for openMSX Catapult 0.11.0 (2014-11-03)
======================================================

Catapult release to match openMSX 0.11.0.

This release we didn't change much, so here is the full list:
- fixed inserting cartridges from Catapult at run time when browsing for a new
  cartridge (it did work when choosing one from history)
- added higher resolution PNG icon for non-Windows systems
- added workaround for Catapult telling that certain extensions are not
  working, although they're working fine

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- the select extension listbox doesn't work properly when using wxWidgets 2.6.x
  (and later) Use the spacebar to deselect extensions! CTRL-click also works.
- not feature complete, especially for newer features you will have to revert to
  the openMSX console (press F10/Cmd+L) or the OSD menu (MENU key/Cmd+O)
