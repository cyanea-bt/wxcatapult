Release Notes for openMSX Catapult 0.5.2-R2 (2005-06-26)
========================================================

This second release of openMSX Catapult 0.5.2 is only a bug fix release.
We found that on platforms that use wxGTK, the extensions didn't work anymore.
This is due to some bug in wxGTK, but we implemented a work around for it in
this release, which should make Catapult usable again. Also, we made some
errors in the new CPU build files, which are corrected in this release.
Note: none of these changes affect Win32 users, so we will not release a new
Win32 binary.
