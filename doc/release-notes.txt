Release Notes for openMSX Catapult 0.10.0 (2014-01-05)
======================================================

Catapult release to match openMSX 0.10.0.

This release we mostly cleaned up the code (so that other people can more
easily help improving Catapult) and fixed some (minor) bugs.

All highlights:
- some updates to recognize the new openMSX machine/extension directory
  structure
- fixes for several small bugs
- fixes for some memory leaks
- updated to libxml 2.8.0
- updated to wxWidgets 2.8.12
- allow setting up multiple IPS files
- added video source setting
- added disable sprites setting (for easy map creating)
- support DMK file extension in file filters
- fixed invalid PNG files (libpng 1.6 would refuse to load them)

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- the select extension listbox doesn't work properly when using wxWidgets 2.6.x
  (and later) Use the spacebar to deselect extensions! CTRL-click also works.
- not feature complete, especially for newer features you will have to revert to
  the openMSX console (press F10) or the OSD menu (MENU key)
