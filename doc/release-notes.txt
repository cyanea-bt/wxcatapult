Release Notes for openMSX Catapult 0.10.1 (2014-04-26)
======================================================

Catapult release to match openMSX 0.10.1.

This release we cleaned up some more code (most of the session page), and
therewith fixed even more bugs. We also added a few new features, most
importantly support for hard disks and support for changing cartridges at run
time. Be careful though, the latter will cause extensions inserted in that slot
to get removed, without Catapult showing you that!

All highlights:
- fixed disk image file not shown on UI when inserting a disk twice
- made behaviour the same for all media (was inconsistent at places)
- added support for changing cartridges at run time
- add DESTDIR support (for packagers)
- made Catapult code compatible with wxWidgets 3.0. It requires 2.8 or 3.0 now.
- fixed several bugs on the session page
- in the history of previously used media, now also store the accompanying IPS
  patches
- fixed setting the video source when there's a space in its name (e.g. Neos
  MA-20)
- removed annoying CTRL-A short cut for the About dialog
- fixed layout of About dialog
- added support for hard disk images (works of course only when such an
  extension is present)
- fixed Catapult interrupting a replay because it plugged in the cassette
  player
- fixed fps-display in the Catapult status bar
- added build support for 64-bit ARM

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- the select extension listbox doesn't work properly when using wxWidgets 2.6.x
  (and later) Use the spacebar to deselect extensions! CTRL-click also works.
- not feature complete, especially for newer features you will have to revert to
  the openMSX console (press F10/Cmd+L) or the OSD menu (MENU key/Cmd+O)
