Release Notes for openMSX Catapult 0.13.0 (2016-07-24)
======================================================

Catapult release to match openMSX 0.13.0.

This release we again didn't change much, so here is the full list:
- Fixed Catapult interrupting a replay directly after loading it
- Fixed drag-and-drop: put dropped file's path in input box, not in history
- Fixed memory leak noticable when reversing
- Fixed performance when reversing
- Fixed failure of handling files with quotes and with [] in their path
- Improved screenshot controls
- Upgraded Visual Studio files to 2015

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- the select extension listbox doesn't work properly. Use the spacebar to
  deselect extensions! CTRL-click also works.
- not feature complete, especially for newer features you will have to revert
  to the openMSX console (press F10/Cmd+L) or the OSD menu (MENU key/Cmd+O)
