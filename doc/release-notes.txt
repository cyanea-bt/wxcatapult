Release Notes for openMSX Catapult 0.7.0-R1 (2008-12-27)
========================================================

This is a release to go with openMSX 0.7.0. The only change is that a bug in
the build system was fixed, nothing else has changed. The plan is still to
release a completely new Catapult soon as possible; unfortunately we didn't
make it in time for openMSX 0.7.0.

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- the select extension listbox doesn't work properly when using wxWidgets 2.6.x
  (and later) Use the spacebar to deselect extensions!
- typing into openMSX doesn't support language specific characters yet
- still not complete, especially for newer features you will have to revert to
  the openMSX console (press F10)
