Release Notes for openMSX Catapult 0.6.1-R1 (2006-07-30)
========================================================

This is a release to make openMSX Catapult compatible with openMSX 0.6.1.
No features were added, only some minor bugs were fixed. The plan is to work
on a successor of Catapult as soon as possible.

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- the select extension listbox doesn't work properly when using wxWidgets 2.6.x
  Use the spacebar to deselect extensions!
- typing into openMSX doesn't support language specific characters yet
- still not complete, especially for newer features you will have to revert to
  the openMSX console (press F10)
