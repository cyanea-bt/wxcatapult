Release Notes for openMSX Catapult 0.7.1 (2009-06-28)
=====================================================

This release comes mostly with good news for Windows users: we have a brand new
installer with binaries which have been created in a brand new way, using
Microsoft Visual C++ 2008. This means smaller binaries and also support for
64-bit Windows operating systems.

Other Windows-specific changes include:
  - Catapult is now a stand-alone binary, statically linked with wxWidgets 2.8.9
    and libxml2 2.7.3.
  - Unicode is now fully supported (no more problems with localized versions of
    Windows e.g.). Note: this means Catapult requires Windows 2000 or higher as
    of this release.

We are working on a new Catapult, but it is not yet in a state where it can
replace this version.

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- the select extension listbox doesn't work properly when using wxWidgets 2.6.x
  (and later) Use the spacebar to deselect extensions!
- not feature complete, especially for newer features you will have to revert to
  the openMSX console (press F10)
