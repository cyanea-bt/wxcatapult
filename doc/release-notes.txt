Release Notes for openMSX Catapult 0.6.3-R1 (2007-12-09)
========================================================

This is a release to make openMSX Catapult compatible with openMSX 0.6.3.
Like previous version, no features were added, only some compatibility issues
were fixed: added new mapper types and translated channel modes to the new
balance settings. The plan is still to release a successor for Catapult as
soon as possible; unfortunately we didn't make it in time for openMSX 0.6.3.

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- the select extension listbox doesn't work properly when using wxWidgets 2.6.x
  Use the spacebar to deselect extensions!
- typing into openMSX doesn't support language specific characters yet
- still not complete, especially for newer features you will have to revert to
  the openMSX console (press F10)
