Release Notes for openMSX Catapult 0.7.1 (2009-06-28)
========================================================

This release comes mostly with good news for Windows users: we have a brand new
installer with binaries which have been created in a brand new way, using
Microsoft Visual C++ 2008. This means smaller binaries and also support for
64-bit Windows operating systems.

Other Windows-specific changes include:
  - Catapult is now a static binary, linked with wxWidgets 2.8.9 and libxml2 2.7.3
  - Unicode is now fully supported (no more problems with localized versions of
    Windows e.g.). Note: this means Catapult requires Windows 2000 or higher as
    of this release.

The plan is still to release a completely new Catapult as soon as possible;
unfortunately we didn't make it in time for openMSX 0.7.1.

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- the select extension listbox doesn't work properly when using wxWidgets 2.6.x
  (and later) Use the spacebar to deselect extensions!
- still not complete, especially for newer features you will have to revert to
  the openMSX console (press F10)
