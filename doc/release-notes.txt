Release Notes for openMSX Catapult 0.4.0-R1 (2004-05-23)
========================================================

This is the first official release, so everything is new. There have been some
versions in the past, but we decided to ignore those in these notes. Unlike
these old versions, openMSX Catapult is not only a front-end, but a
full-fledged GUI for openMSX.

Features:
- Select machine and multiple extensions
- Select media to put in the MSX (disk/tape/carts)
- Disks and tapes can be changed when openMSX is running
- Various controls to vary the openMSX speed (speed, max frameskip, throttle)
- Ability to plug devices into the joystick ports (before and at run time)
- openMSX render control (renderer, scalers, accuracy, blur, glow, gamma and
  scanlines)
- Complete audio mixer (consisting of all available sounddevices)
- MIDI in/out pluggable support (for TurboR GT)
- PCM Wave input selection (for TurboR)
- openMSX errors and warnings display
- MSX LEDs visualisation
- Frame rate indicator
- Full communication with openMSX (back and forth)

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- far from complete
