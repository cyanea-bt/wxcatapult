Release Notes for openMSX Catapult 0.11.1 (2015-xx-xx)
======================================================

Catapult release to match openMSX 0.11.1.

This release we again didn't change much, so here is the full list:
- Query machine and extension list directly from openMSX. This also eliminates
  the share dir setting, which was confusing our users, as they thought they
  could use it to configure openMSX, while it was only meant to let Catapult
  find the list of extensions and machines.
- Query ROM mapper type list from openMSX. This makes sure that Catapult will
  always offer all possible mapper types that are supported by openMSX. It also
  means not all have a full description, as that is not queried (yet) from
  openMSX.
- Fix handling of MIDI connectors: it only supported MSX-MIDI, now it is
  generic.

Known issues / caveats:
- comboboxes behave a bit strangely sometimes on non-Windows systems
- the select extension listbox doesn't work properly when using wxWidgets 2.6.x
  (and later) Use the spacebar to deselect extensions! CTRL-click also works.
- not feature complete, especially for newer features you will have to revert to
  the openMSX console (press F10/Cmd+L) or the OSD menu (MENU key/Cmd+O)
